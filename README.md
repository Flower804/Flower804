I've been programing since 2018 mainly using Python or C++ <br>
But I mostly use C++, Java or C <br>
But I also know languages like, Rust, Javascript and PHP, and scripting languages like PowerShell and Shellscript <br>
Right now I'm in college taking a degree in Computer Science, but I've already worked on many programming teams and participated in Hackathons and coding competitions, and I privatly teach programming, mainly teaching C and Python since that's what's most commonly asked of me <br>
